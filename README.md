Make sure you have the NLTK available from a public location
.e.g.
sudo python3 -m nltk.downloader -d /usr/local/share/nltk_data omw



Make sure you have the grammars in place (app-folder/static/...)


You must install:
flask_mail
lxml
delphin

pip install flask_mail
pip install lxml 
pip install delphin




python3.6 -m pip install flask_login

sudo apt-get install flask_login

sudo pip install flask_mail

sudo apt-get install -y python3-flask-login


sudo apt-get install python3-lxml


+ apparently there is a difference between using pip and apt-get (apache2/wsgi can't see what pip installs !!!)
