<h3>Callig: Computer-Assisted Language Learning using Improvisational Games</h3>
<br>

<p>CALLIG, Computer-Assisted Language Learning using Improvisational Games, is an online platform (in development) for playing verbal improvisational games, which are generally played face-to-face and in collaboration.</p>

<p>In an improvisation performance, suggestions are elicited from the audience. In CALLIG, suggestions are randomly generated by the system. Spontaneity in improvisation is implemented with the use of a timer.</p>

<p>At this stage, only single-player games have been implemented. All games require the cognitive skills of remote association and/or divergent thinking. Both are hallmarks of creativity. These games provide contexts for creative language use.</p>

<p>Our games come from: (i) existing improvisational games; (ii) modifying existing games and (iii) new games designed by the team.</p>
