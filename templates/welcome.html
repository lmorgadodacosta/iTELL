<h4> Welcome to CALLIG!</h4>

<br>
<p>CALLIG, Computer-Assisted Language Learning using Improvisational Games, is an online platform (in development) for playing verbal improvisational games, which are generally played face-to-face and in collaboration.</p>

<p>In an improvisation performance, suggestions are elicited from the audience. In CALLIG, suggestions are randomly generated by the system. Spontaneity in improvisation is implemented with the use of a timer.</p>

<p>At this stage, only single-player games have been implemented. All games require the cognitive skills of remote association and/or divergent thinking. Both are hallmarks of creativity. These games provide contexts for creative language use.</p>

<p>Our games come from: (i) existing improvisational games; (ii) modifying existing games and (iii) new games designed by the team.</p>

<h6>Games in the making</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Haiku (5-7-5 syllables requirement, random title, must-use word)</li>
  <li>Proverb (give Noun+Verb/Noun+Noun/Noun+Adjective, they write a proverb, grammatical), then explain the usage </li>
  <li>Sex with me </li>
  <li>Association: 2 nouns... link them (levels: Adj+Noun, Adj+Noun?, time, X number of links)</li>
  <li>Storytelling, random title, 1 word per sentence </li>
</ul>

<h6>We need a timer. (either to cut people off, or to store how long they took)</h6>

<br>
<h6>FOR THE FUTURE:</h6>
<ul>
  <li>game levels</li>
  <li>voting systems</li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>


<h6>FOR THE DISPLAY:</h6>
 we are thinking of displaying only 1 random result at a time...

<br>
<br>
"Sex with me is like..."  by Anonymous
<br>
<br>


<h6>FOR THE GRAMMAR CORRECTION:</h6>
I'm thinking that I would like to not break the flow of the game unless there is something wrong with the sentence. Maybe on submission I can try to have the grammar loaded and just get a parse from it... if the grammar finds anything wrong, then we show an intermediate page about that sentence. (maybe even allowing them to correct their sentence?)



There is some bug on resubmitting things when the clock automatically cycles through.
After countdown, make input and submit disappear.
